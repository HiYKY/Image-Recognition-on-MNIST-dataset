# Image-Recognition-on-MNIST-dataset


In this repository, I compared the performance of different methods of image recognition on MNIST dataset. The database consists of a total of 70000 including 60000 training samples and 10000 test samples. I used K-NN, Support Vector Machine, Spatial Pyramid Matching, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Deep Belief Nets. After training the CNN model with the whole MNIST dataset, I divide the dataset into 10000 training-set and 2000 test-set to overcome memory and computational challenges on other methods.
